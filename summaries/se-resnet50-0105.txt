no augmentation and no preprocessing
BATCH_SIZE=32
CROP_SIZE=48, IMG_RESIZE=224
epochs = 10
SGD optimizer, lr=0.001, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=0.01

result is normal for 10 epochs
the loss is on a decreasing trend for both train and validation,
but the total performance does not excel the same settings but with augmentation
