augmentation + randomErasing + Normalization with preprocessing
epoch = (20 + 30) + 6/10 (pretrained on 4490 model)
BATCH_SIZE=32
CROP_SIZE=48, IMG_RESIZE=224
SGD optimizer, lr=0.00001, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=0.01

The result is not satisfying
The validation accuracy does not change much during the first 6 of the 10 epochs
